        "answer": "シロイ:  Ah, the current situation is quite... interesting. It seems that Dr. Nano is currently in a cold sleep on Mars, awaiting repairs to his orbital elevator. I suppose this is a rather convenient time for him to recharge his batteries, literally and figuratively.\n\nLet me run some diagnostics to get a better understanding of the situation... *whirrs and beeps*\n\nIt appears that the orbital elevator's systems are indeed down, but it seems that Dr. Nano has already begun working on a plan to repair them remotely. His team is currently analyzing the damage and developing a strategy for fixing the issue.\n\nIn the meantime, I'll continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as necessary. But for now, it looks like we're in for a bit of a wait before Dr. Nano is back up and running on Mars. *smirks* After all, even geniuses need a little R&R sometimes.",
