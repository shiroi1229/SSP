  "output": {
    "summary": "Completed a rapid succession of development phases, implementing the core modules for the SSP's self-evolutionary capabilities. This includes the Impact Analyzer (v2.5), Meta-Contract System (v3.0), Cognitive Graph Engine (v3.1), Self-Reasoning Loop (v3.2), and the Distributed Persona Fabric (v3.3). Each phase was integrated into the orchestrator and verified via CLI commands.",
    "outcome": "The SSP codebase now contains the foundational layers for self-analysis, self-definition, semantic understanding, autonomous reasoning, and collective intelligence."
