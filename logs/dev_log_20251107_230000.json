  "summary": "Fixed backend and frontend API endpoint configuration issues.",
  "details": {
    "issue": "User reported incorrect LLM URL and a 'Failed to fetch' error on the chat UI. Investigation revealed multiple points of failure in API communication.",
    "investigation": [
      "Found LLM URL was not configured in model_params.json.",
      "Discovered that modules/generator.py was bypassing the central llm.py module and using its own hardcoded URL logic.",
      "Identified that frontend/app/chat/page.tsx was using a hardcoded, incorrect backend URL instead of the Next.js proxy."
    ],
    "changes": [
      {
        "file": "config/model_params.json",
        "change": "Added the correct 'llm_url' for the LM Studio endpoint (http://172.25.208.1:1234/v1)."
      },
      {
        "file": "modules/generator.py",
        "change": "Refactored the module to remove direct API calls (urllib) and instead use the centralized 'analyze_text' function from modules/llm.py. This unifies the LLM calling logic."

      {
        "file": "frontend/app/chat/page.tsx",
        "change": "Replaced the hardcoded backend URL with a relative path ('/api/chat') to correctly utilize the Next.js rewrite proxy."

    "outcome": "Backend and frontend are now correctly configured to communicate with each other and with the external LLM service. The full chat workflow is expected to be functional."
