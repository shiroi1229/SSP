Used the `replace` tool to modify /api/evaluate and /api/chat, commenting out calls to the missing 'run_orchestrator_workflow' and replacing them with placeholder logic. This provides a temporary fix, allowing the server to run while deferring the full migration of these endpoints to the new v2.2 architecture.",

  "notes": "This debugging session highlights a dependency conflict between the new v2.2 architecture and legacy API endpoints. The chosen solution prioritizes server stability while creating technical debt (incomplete migration of 'evaluate' and 'chat' APIs) that needs to be addressed in a future task."
