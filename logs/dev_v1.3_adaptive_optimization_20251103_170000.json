    "summary": "Implemented all core phases for v1.3 Adaptive Optimization: Analyzer Bridge, Optimization Core, Feedback Integration, and Automation & Scheduling. The system can now automatically generate self-analysis reports, parse them to adjust LLM parameters, and schedule these optimizations.",
    "details": {
      "Phase 1 - Analyzer Bridge": "Modified backend/api/analyze_sessions.py to call modules.self_optimizer.apply_self_optimization() after report generation. Also improved error handling for LLM JSON parsing and added params_updated to API response.",
      "Phase 2 - Optimization Core": "Implemented logic in modules/self_optimizer.py to parse self-analysis reports, extract average evaluation score, and dynamically adjust model parameters (temperature, top_p) based on score. Optimization results are logged to logs/optimization_log.json. Replaced print statements with logging.",
      "Phase 3 - Feedback Integration": "Modified modules/llm.py to load dynamic parameters from config/model_params.json and use them in the LLM call payload. Added timestamp and source_model to simulated LLM response.",
      "Phase 4 - Automation & Scheduling": "Modified orchestrator/scheduler.py to import job_adaptive_optimization and add a new weekly schedule entry for it."
