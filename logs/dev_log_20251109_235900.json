  "summary": "The 'UI-v1.3 Persona Dashboard' has been fully implemented, integrating PersonaMonitor, PersonaEditor, and PersonaEvolution into a unified UI. This includes a loading animation and design adjustments. Several critical bugs were addressed during this phase:\n\n- **Frontend TypeError and NaN errors**: Resolved in PersonaEvolution.tsx by adding defensive checks for missing data.\n- **WebSocket URL Correction**: Fixed in frontend/app/chat/page.tsx to correctly point to the backend's WebSocket endpoint.\n- **Backend Routing 404 Not Found errors**: Standardized API router prefix handling across backend/main.py and relevant API files (sessions.py, context.py, chat.py, analyze_sessions.py). The pattern is now to define APIRouter without a prefix in the API file and include it with a prefix in main.py.\n- **CORS Policy Block**: Added CORSMiddleware to backend/main.py to resolve CORS issues between the frontend and backend.\n- **Frontend Hardcoded Session IDs**: Modified frontend/app/chat/page.tsx to dynamically fetch session data from /api/sessions, resolving 404 errors caused by hardcoded session IDs.\n- **RAGEngine Resilience**: Refactored modules/rag_engine.py to be more resilient to initialization failures, logging errors and disabling functionality instead of crashing.\n\nAll reported errors have been addressed, and the system is now functioning as expected based on the latest logs.",
