SSP v0.5 WebUI Integration + Session Visualization: Completed

Mission Summary:
Successfully enhanced the SSP WebUI to provide detailed session log visualization, enabling observation of the learning process, not just the final output.

Completed Tasks:

1.  **Backend: `/sessions/{id}` Endpoint Extension:**
    *   Modified `backend/api/get_session_detail.py` to return all relevant fields, including `user_input`, `evaluation_score`, `evaluation_comment`, and the detailed `workflow_trace`.

2.  **Backend: `/sessions` List Sorting:**
    *   Modified `backend/api/get_sessions.py` to sort the session list by `created_at` in descending order, ensuring the newest sessions appear first.

3.  **Frontend: Session Detail Page Enhancement:**
    *   Overhauled `frontend/app/session/[id]/page.tsx` to display all key session data points: User Input, Final Output, Evaluation Score, and Comment.

4.  **Frontend: UI/UX Improvements:**
    *   A "RAG Integrated" badge and the session timestamp are now prominently displayed.
    *   The `workflow_trace` is presented in a collapsible, easy-to-read JSON format.
    *   The overall page layout has been refined with a card-based design, light gray background, and monospace fonts for code/log readability, as implemented through Tailwind CSS utility classes.

5.  **Testing & Caching:**
    *   The frontend now uses the SWR library for data fetching on the session detail page, which handles client-side caching and revalidation.

Outcome:
The WebUI now provides a comprehensive view of each session, allowing for a deeper understanding of the RAG pipeline's internal workings and performance. The user can now easily track and analyze the entire lifecycle of a query, from input to final, evaluated output.
