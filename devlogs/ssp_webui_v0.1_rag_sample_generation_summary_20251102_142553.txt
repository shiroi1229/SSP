## Gemini Added Memories
- The v0.1 integration test for the SSP WebUI is functionally complete. The FastAPI backend is running and serving session data from PostgreSQL. The Next.js frontend is successfully displaying this data. All previous errors, including CORS issues, database schema mismatches (sessions vs. session_logs, timestamp vs. created_at, query/context/answer vs. user_input/workflow_trace/final_output/evaluation_score/evaluation_comment), and regex parsing failures in the generator, have been resolved. The full RAG pipeline (RAG Engine -> Generator -> Evaluator -> Memory Store) is operational. The only remaining known issue is the garbled Japanese output from the LM Studio model, which is an external encoding problem and not part of this integration test's scope. The next task is '評価入力ルーチン補強' (Evaluation Input Routine Enhancement).
- Current progress on '評価入力ルーチン補強' (Evaluation Input Routine Enhancement): The backend PATCH /sessions/{session_id} endpoint has been successfully implemented in backend/api/post_session.py. This includes a Pydantic model for the request body (SessionEvaluationUpdate) with validation for evaluation_score (1-5) and evaluation_comment (max 100 chars). The endpoint retrieves a session by ID, updates its evaluation_score and evaluation_comment, and commits changes to the database. Error handling for not-found sessions and database issues is included. The next step is to implement the frontend changes.
- **Phase 1.5: Automatic Generation of RAG Samples (RAG用サンプル自動生成)** has been successfully implemented.
    - A new module `modules/sample_generator.py` was created to automatically generate RAG learning materials.
    - The `Sample` SQLAlchemy model was added to `backend/db/models.py` to store generated samples.
    - The `insert_sample` function and `create_all_tables` function were added to `backend/db/connection.py` to handle database operations for samples.
    - The `orchestrator/main.py` script was modified to include an `--auto-sample` argument, which triggers the automatic sample generation process.
    - The `modules/generator.py` was updated to correctly parse the LLM's JSON response, specifically extracting content from `choices[0].message.content`, resolving a `final_output` parsing error.
    - The system can now successfully generate RAG samples, save them to JSON files in `data/samples`, and insert them into the PostgreSQL database.
