Summary of conversation up to 2025-10-26 17:59:00:

- User inquired about Gemini CLI running on their account and billing plans; clarified that CLI operation is separate.
- Encountered "Gemini CLI command not found" error with `dev_logger.py`; user resolved PATH issue.
- Corrected `dev_logger.py` for improper `gemini` CLI command usage (removed 'chat' subcommand).
- Identified `gemini` CLI's restriction on `write_file` and `run_shell_command` tools for the model.
- Patched `dev_logger.py` (v0.2) to capture `gemini` CLI's `stdout` (expected code) and save it to `D:\gemini\out`, with a log entry in `D:\gemini\devlogs`.
- Created `orchestrator/main.py` and `orchestrator/workflow.py` from the captured output.
- Clarified that `gemini` CLI is a tool, not the agent, and `dev_logger.py` logs external `gemini` CLI interactions, not our direct conversation.
- User requested to save a summary of *this* conversation to `devlogs` upon instruction.
