The v0.1 integration test for the SSP WebUI is functionally complete. The FastAPI backend is running and serving session data from PostgreSQL. The Next.js frontend is successfully displaying this data. All previous errors, including CORS issues, database schema mismatches (sessions vs. session_logs, timestamp vs. created_at, query/context/answer vs. user_input/workflow_trace/final_output/evaluation_score/evaluation_comment), and regex parsing failures in the generator, have been resolved. The full RAG pipeline (RAG Engine -> Generator -> Evaluator -> Memory Store) is operational. The only remaining known issue is the garbled Japanese output from the LM Studio model, which is an external encoding problem and not part of this integration test's scope. The next task is '評価入力ルーチン補強' (Evaluation Input Routine Enhancement).
